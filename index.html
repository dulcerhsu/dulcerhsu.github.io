					<br />

					<p>Therapy holds immense importance in our lives, providing a unique space for
						self-exploration,
						growth, and healing. It offers a confidential and non-judgmental environment where individuals
						can express their thoughts, emotions, and experiences freely. Through therapy, we gain a deeper
						understanding of ourselves, our patterns, and the factors that influence our behaviors. It
						empowers us to navigate life's challenges, manage stress, and cope with emotional difficulties.
					</p>

					<p>
						Therapy equips us with valuable tools and strategies to enhance our well-being, build
						resilience, and cultivate healthier relationships. It promotes self-awareness, self-compassion,
						and personal growth, allowing us to live more fulfilling and authentic lives. By seeking
						therapy, we embrace the opportunity to invest in our mental, emotional, and overall holistic
						well-being.<br /><br /><br />

		<!-- About Me -->

			<section class="wrapper style3">
				<div class="inner">

					<h3>Hi there, I'm Dulce</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headshot.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I hold a
						Master's of Science degree in School-Based Family Counseling from California State University,
						Los Angeles, and a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Psychology with a minor in Spanish from the
						University of California, Riverside. My educational background, coupled with my hands-on
						experience, has equipped me with a solid foundation in counseling theories and interventions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in providing therapy to diverse
						populations. As a School Counselor at Ralph Bunche Academy in the Oakland Unified School
						District, I have worked individually with at-risk students, creating personalized graduation
						plans, identifying necessary supports and resources, and assisting with postsecondary planning.
						My time as a Transitional Age Youth Clinician at WestCoast Children's Clinic allowed me to
						provide trauma-informed psychotherapy and intensive clinical case management to vulnerable
						children and youth. I also conducted mental health screenings and facilitated access to
						resources for youth who were sexually exploited or at risk.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my counseling practice, I prioritize creating a safe and non-judgmental space where clients
						can explore their emotions, develop coping strategies, and work towards personal growth. I am
						skilled in conducting comprehensive mental health assessments, formulating treatment plans, and
						implementing evidence-based therapeutic interventions. With credentials in Pupil Personnel
						Services, Child Welfare and Attendance, and a License in Marriage and Family Therapy, I bring a
						strong foundation of knowledge and expertise to my work. Furthermore, my fluency in English and
						Spanish allows me to effectively communicate and connect with individuals from diverse
						backgrounds.
					</p>
					<!-- <p align="justify">
						I am committed to ongoing professional development and staying up-to-date with the latest
						research and therapeutic techniques. I actively engage in continuing education opportunities to
						further enhance my skills in trauma-focused therapy, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and
						mindfulness practices. My dedication to growth and learning ensures that I am equipped to
						provide the highest quality of care to my clients.
					</p> -->
					<p>
						I understand that reaching out for therapy can be a courageous step, and I want to assure you
						that I will provide a confidential and non-judgmental environment where you can freely express
						yourself. My goal is to establish a therapeutic alliance built on trust, empathy, and mutual
						respect. Together, we will work towards creating positive change and fostering personal growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am currently accepting new clients and would be delighted to have the opportunity to support
						you on your journey towards healing and self-discovery. If you are interested in scheduling an
						initial consultation or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to
						listen, support, and guide you every step of the way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Warm regards,
					</p>
					<p>
						Dulce Hsu, LMFT
					</p>

					<h4>Therapy in Spanish</h4>
					<p>I am thrilled to offer therapy services in both English and Spanish, ensuring
						that I can cater to
						a diverse range of individuals seeking support. I understand the significance of effective
						communication and the comfort that comes with expressing oneself in one's native language. By
						providing therapy services in Spanish, I strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment
						where clients can freely share their thoughts, emotions, and experiences.</p>

					<p>Whether you prefer
						English or Spanish, I am here to guide you on your journey towards personal growth, healing, and
						well-being.</p>
